\section{Future work}
\label{sec:future-work}

We are working on expanding the Twig language with a notion of \emph{functors}. Functors cleanly capture most cases in which users might need to generate loop constructs, allocate/free patterns, or other protocols that require a notion of \emph{context}.

We are also investigating a number of ways in which Twig might be more closely integrated with mainstream coding practices. For example, we imagine that it may be possible for Twig code to live in the background, and express protocol logic through declarative annotations in the application code.

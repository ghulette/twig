Set up multi-target problem.

Why is formal term rewriting better than SWIG?

Twig has several advantages over SWIG:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Twig typemaps are composable.
\item Twig typemaps are polymorphic.
\end{enumerate}

Structure in Twig terms.

First, we have n-ary tuples, which are constructed using \texttt{tuple} and may
contain any number of children. Special operations are \texttt{branch},
\texttt{congruence}, \texttt{pick}, and \texttt{permute}.

Second, we have functors, which capture the intuitive idea of collections or
contexts.

% fmap id = id
% (fmap f) . (fmap g) = fmap (f . g)
% 
% [array(_,int) -> ] {
%   for(\$i=0;\$i < n;\$i++){
%     
%   }
% }

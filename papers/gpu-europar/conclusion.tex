\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have introduced the concept of separating the protocol logic  inherent to hybrid systems from the computational and application logic of a program. We have demonstrated that a type-based approach can enforce this separation by making explicit in data types information related to both data location, and the representation of the data itself. By doing so, we allow the protocol logic of a program to be expressed via operations exclusively on located types. Many explicit programming chores become implicit features of the generated code, such as declaring intermediate values or reducing redundant memory movement. Finally, by adopting a code generation approach, we show that users of these higher level abstractions are not prohibited from both tuning the resultant code and composing independently developed programs that utilize standardized hybrid programming libraries like OpenCL or CUDA.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have introduced the concept of separating the protocol logic that is inherent to hybrid systems from the computational logic that forms the domain specific intent of a program that uses the system. We have demonstrated that a type-based approach can enforce this separation by making explicit in data types information related to both the locale in which data resides, and the representation of the data itself. By doing so, we allow the protocol logic of a program to be expressed via operations exclusively on located types. Many explicit programming chores become implicit features of the generated code, such as declaring intermediate values or reducing redundant memory movement. Finally, by adopting a code generation approach, we show that users of these higher level abstractions are not prohibited from both tuning the resultant code and composing together independently developed programs that utilize standardized hybrid programming libraries like OpenCL or CUDA.

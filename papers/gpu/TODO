Expand section on Located Types
* More of an overview of the technique - what and why, skip the how

Look into automatically inserting coercions, i.e. reductions of the form
    
    [_ -> gpu(T)];[T -> _] => [_ -> gpu(T)];[gpu(T) -> T];[T -> _]

Code generation
* more details on how to do it in practice
* give an example, show how code is connected
* expand on identity part - why do we want it?

Use CUDA in the example

Based on the following CUDA example:
http://llpanorama.wordpress.com/2008/05/21/my-first-cuda-program/

There are two files:
* example1.cu - What we should generate without reductions
* example2.cu - What we should generate after reductions have been applied

Build each file with something like:
$nvcc -I/usr/local/cuda/include/ -L/usr/local/cuda/lib/ goal.cu

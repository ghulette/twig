\section{Twig}

Overview of how Twig works, basic semantics, code generation, simple example.

Focus on importance of generating C - integration with existing methods, type-directed generation.

\subsection{Term rewriting and how it fits here}

This is not the real subsection title.

\subsection{Reductions}

Explain reductions and how they can be used in domain- or application-specific
ways.

Explain built-in reductions. Maybe discuss idea of a normal form, although
this might be better in a later paper.

\subsection{Implementation}

Talk briefly about how Twig is implemented, and how to use it to generate
code.

\begin{abstract}

Numerous programming models have been introduced in the last few years to
allow programmers to utilize new accelerator-based architectures. While OpenCL
and CUDA represent similar low-level abstractions for programming
accelerators, most often based on GPU processors, few higher level programming
models have emerged that are compatible with common general purpose languages.
In this paper, we propose that extensions to the type systems of traditional
general purpose languages can be made that allow programmers to continue to
work at a high level of abstraction with respect to memory, deferring much of
the tedium of data management and movement code in OpenCL or CUDA to an
automatic compilation tool. Furthermore, the techniques based on formal term
rewriting that are described in this paper take advantage of reduction and
simplification rules that can be used to optimize memory optimizations to
reduce unnecessary storage requirements and transfer activity.

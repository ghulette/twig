\begin{abstract}

Numerous programming models have been introduced to allow programmers to
utilize new accelerator-based architectures. While OpenCL and CUDA provide
low-level access to accelerator programming (typically GPUs), the task cries
out for a higher level abstraction. Of the higher level programming models
which have emerged, none are intended to co-exist with mainstream, general
purpose languages. In this paper, we propose that extensions to the type
systems of traditional general purpose languages can be made that allow
programmers to work at a higher level of abstraction with respect to memory,
deferring much of the tedium of data management and movement code in OpenCL or
CUDA to an automatic compilation tool. Furthermore, our techniques, based on
formal term rewriting, take advantage of reduction and simplification rules
that can reduce unnecessary data motion to and from the accelerator.

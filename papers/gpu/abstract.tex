\begin{abstract}

Numerous programming models have been introduced to allow programmers to utilize new accelerator-based architectures. While OpenCL and CUDA provide low-level access to accelerator programming (typically GPUs), the task cries out for a higher level abstraction. Of the higher level programming models which have emerged, few are intended to co-exist with mainstream, general purpose languages while supporting tunability, composability, and transparency of implementation. In this paper, we propose that extensions to the type systems (implementable as syntactically neutral annotations) of traditional general purpose languages can be made that allow programmers to work at a higher level of abstraction with respect to memory, deferring much of the tedium of data management and movement code to an automatic code generation tool. Furthermore, our techniques, based on formal term rewriting, take advantage of reduction and simplification rules that allow the optimization of low level operations to be exposed as user-tunable rewriting operations.

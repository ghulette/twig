\begin{abstract}

Numerous programming models have been introduced to allow programmers
to utilize new accelerator-based architectures. While OpenCL and CUDA
provide low-level access to accelerator programming (typically GPUs),
the task cries out for a higher level abstraction. Of the higher level
programming models which have emerged, few are intended to co-exist
with mainstream, general purpose languages while supporting
tunability, composability, and transparency of implementation. In this
paper, we propose that extensions to the type systems (implementable
as syntactically neutral annotations) of traditional general purpose
languages can be made that allow programmers to work at a higher level
of abstraction with respect to memory, deferring much of the tedium of
data management and movement code in lower level libaries like OpenCL
or CUDA to an automatic compilation tool. Furthermore, our techniques,
based on formal term rewriting, take advantage of reduction and
simplification rules that allow optimization of low level operations
to be exposed as user-tunable rewriting operations.

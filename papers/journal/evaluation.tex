\chapter{Evaluation of Twig}
\label{ch:eval}

In this chapter we will show how Twig may be used for a variety of
applications. First, in Section~\ref{sec:eval:swig}, we compare
Twig against SWIG, the best-known system that uses typemaps. In
Section~\ref{sec:eval:multi-lang}, we demonstrate how Twig's
abstract code generation model can be used to work with multiple
target languages in the same typemap. Finally, in
Section~\ref{sec:eval:gpu}, we show how GPU programming, a
seemingly dissimilar problem, can also benefit from Twig's
approach to multi-targeted programming.

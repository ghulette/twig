\begin{abstract}

Twig is a language for writing \emph{typemaps}, programs which
transform the type of a value while preserving its underlying
meaning. Typemaps are typically used by tools that generate code,
such as multi-language wrapper generators, to automatically
convert types as needed. Twig builds on existing typemap tools in
a few key ways. Twig's typemaps are composable so that complex
transformations may be built from simpler ones. In addition, Twig
incorporates an abstract, formal model of code generation,
allowing it to output code for different target languages. We
describe Twig's formal semantics and show how the language allows
us to concisely express typemaps. Then, we demonstrate Twig's
utility by building an example typemap.

title = {WOOL: A Workflow Programming Language},
abstract = {Workflows offer scientists a simple but flexible programming model at a level of abstraction closer to the domain-specific activities that they seek to perform. However, languages for describing workflows tend to be highly complex, or specialized towards a particular domain, or both. WOOL is an abstract workflow language with human-readable syntax, intuitive semantics, and a powerful abstract type system. WOOL workflows can be targeted to almost any kind of runtime system supporting data-flow computation. This paper describes the design of the WOOL language and the implementation of its compiler, along with a simple example runtime. We demonstrate its use in an image-processing workflow.},

title = {A Core Language for Rewriting},
abstract = {System S is a calculus providing the basic abstractions of term rewriting: matching and building terms, term traversal, combining computations and handling failure. The calculus forms a core language for implementation of a wide variety of rewriting languages, or more generally, languages for specifying tree transformations. In this paper we show how a conventional rewriting language based on conditional term rewriting can be implemented straightforwardly in System S. Subsequently we show how this implementation can be extended with features such as matching conditions, negative conditions, default rules, non-strictness annotations and alternative evaluation strategies.},

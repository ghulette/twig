\section{Evaluation}

In contrast to projects such as Fig, we have designed Twig as an enhanced version of the typemap facility already found in Swig.

Twig has several advantages over Swig's existing typemap facility.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Sequencing - simple typemaps can be sequenced to produce more complex typemaps.
  \item Choice - Using the choice combinator, conditionally-generated typemaps become possible.
  \item Tuples - Twig allows sets of types to be mapped together, using tuples. This is a common problem -- consider function argument lists, or a pointer paired with a length to form an array.
  \item Type variables - allows polymorphic typemaps, e.g., \texttt{[ptr(A) -> A]}.
  \item Twig can generate target languages other than C.
\end{enumerate}

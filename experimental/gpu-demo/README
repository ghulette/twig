The idea is to provide a processing pipeline that loads an image in Java,
marshalls it to C, processes it on the GPU, and then unmarshalls it back to
Java and saves it.

It is important that Twig be able to eliminate some intermediate operations.
In particular, it would be good to move the image data directly from Java to
the GPU, skipping the C runtime.

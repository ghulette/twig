Normalization. The goal is to come up with maximal sequences. 

1. Anonymous rules broken out and named.
2. Other expression names substituted (including in reduction spec). Or maybe not?
In the following steps, f, g, h, etc are atomic rules, while E is an expression
3. (f|g);h => (f;h) | (g;h)
4. f;(g|h) => (f;g) | (f;h)
5. {f,g};{h,k} => {f;h,g;k}
